subtitle: Overview
project_title: "Smart Water Contamination Detection Usinng AI model"

problem: |
  The project focuses on addressing the critical issues of drinking water safely by developing an AI-driven system to predict contaminnation risks from lead, heavy metals, and microbial pollutants. The project aims to analyze public health reports for early detection of waterborne diseases. The ultimate goal is to empower water authorities with a proactive tool for mitigating contaminants and ensuring safer water access. Students will gain hands-on experience in AI/ML techniques, Python coding, and data analysis while contributing to a meaningful public health solution.

approach: |
  This project requires hardware tools like water quality sensors for measuring contamination
levels and an Arduino microcontroller for data collection and transmission. The circuit setup
consists of water quality sensors connected to the Arduino via analog pins, with resistors and
capacitors stabilizing signals. A breadboard and jumper wires will facilitate connections, while
a power source (battery) will ensure stable operation. Software tools such as Python and Google Colab will support data analysis and AI modeltraining. AI frameworks like TensorFlow and Scikit-learn enable machine learning applications wil be used for for identifying contamination patterns. For data acquisition, Google Sheets will facilitate real-time sensor data collection, while AWS cloud provides efficient storage for large datasets. Deployment and visualization tools like AWS Sagemaker will allow web-based AI model interaction.



outcome: |
  - Successful connection, calibration ofwater quality sensors
  - Build an AI model that can spot contamination patterns and fine-tune it for accuracy.
