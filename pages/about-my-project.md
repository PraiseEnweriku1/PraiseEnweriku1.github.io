subtitle: Overview
project_title: "Smart Water Contamination Detection Usinng AI model"

problem: |
  The project focuses on addressing the critical issues of drinking water safely by developing an AI-driven system to predict contaminnation risks from lead, heavy metals, and microbial pollutants. The project aims to analyze public health reports for early detection of waterborne diseases. The ultimate goal is to empower water authorities with a proactive tool for mitigating contaminants and ensuring safer water access. Students will gain hands-on experience in AI/ML techniques, Python coding, and data analysis while contributing to a meaningful public health solution.

outcome: |
  - Successful connection, calibration ofwater quality sensors
  - Build an AI model that can spot contamination patterns and fine-tune it for accuracy.
