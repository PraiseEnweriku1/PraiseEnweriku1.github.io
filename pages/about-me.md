  bio: |
    I’m currently a Senior studying Cloud Computing at Morgan State University in Baltimore, Maryland. I expect to graduate in 2025.

    My work explores smart water contamination detection using AI model 

    When I’m not working on research, I enjoy playing drums, and the piano. I also love to go to the gym because I can just put on my headphones and be in my own head space for about 2 hrs which is therapeutic for me!
