what_i_learned: |
  Today, I worked on a video review that summarized my accomplishments and challenges from the past week. This exercise taught me how important it is to reflect not only on what I accomplished, but also on how I communicate those accomplishments. Sometimes, I move so quickly through tasks that I forget to pause and appreciate the progress being made. Preparing for the video made me revisit documentation, check our shared project files, and go over emails and notes to jog my memory. That process alone helped me realize just how much behind the scenes work we’ve done.I also learned that presenting your work visually or verbally is a different skill than just completing the work. I had to think about how to explain our sensor selection research to someone unfamiliar with the process, which forced me to better understand it myself. Lastly, I learned the value of planning having a clear set of goals for the next phase made our video more purposeful and focused.

  When recording the video, I found it difficult to explain some of our technical challenges clearly. I realized that while I understood the problems internally, articulating them in a way that others could understand was much harder. This slowed down my recording process and required multiple takes to get things right.

reflection: |
  Reflecting on the day, I found that the hardest part was not collecting the information but communicating it effectively. I had a mental list of everything we had done, but turning that into a structured video presentation was surprisingly challenging. I often paused mid-sentence trying to figure out how to say what I was thinking. It showed me how important communication skills are, especially when working in teams. The process pushed me out of my comfort zone, and I appreciated that growth. It made me realize that I want to get better at public speaking and explaining technical concepts with confidence. I also noticed that once I got into the rhythm of speaking, I was able to connect ideas more naturally. Going forward, I plan to practice summarizing my progress verbally on a regular basis to help with future presentations.
