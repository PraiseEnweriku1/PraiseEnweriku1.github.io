what_i_learned: |
  I learned the difference between Git and Github. I realised Git is just a versioning control system, while Github is where  we  actually store our files and folders that can be accessed by different members on a team. I also learned how to add files like pictures, and text to my Github website.

blockers: |
  I encountered some problems with adding my picture to the website, but after changing the extension and refreshing the page, it worked.

reflection: |
  It was an exciting first day learning how to us Git and Github because It's something I'm going to use when I get into the Job market. Looking forward to learning more!
