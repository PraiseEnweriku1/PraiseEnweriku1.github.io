what_i_learned: |
  Today, we had a research writing workshop in the morning where we learned about structuring academic papers effectively. The workshop emphasized how to write strong introductions, organize literature reviews, and integrate citations to support our research claims. We also did an activity that helped me practice outlining ideas quickly and connecting them to existing research, which I found useful for planning my paper sections. When I got back to the lab, I focused on writing the **literature review section of our research paper**. I read through several articles related to water contamination detection, IoT-based water quality monitoring systems, and machine learning classification of water parameters. Summarizing and synthesizing these studies showed me how to connect our project to existing knowledge in the field.

reflection: |
   Overall, today was productive because I gained new academic writing skills from the workshop and directly applied them to my literature review draft. It felt motivating to see the research paper come together piece by piece and to recognize how our project builds upon prior studies. I’m looking forward to completing the literature review tomorrow and starting to refine the methodology and results sections later this week. As a team today, we continued working individually on different parts of the research paper** to keep it moving forward. My main contribution was drafting summaries of related studies and highlighting the research gaps that our project addresses in the field of water quality monitoring.
