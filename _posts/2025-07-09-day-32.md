what_i_learned: |
  Today, I focused on continuing the calibration work for our turbidity and pH sensors. We spent time testing different water samples and adjusting our Arduino code to try and get more stable and accurate readings. I learned how sensitive sensors can be to wiring setups, sample container materials, and small code changes. This reminded me of the importance of testing under consistent conditions when collecting data for machine learning. I also spent time working on our machine learning models in Google Colab, reviewing our data preprocessing steps to make sure everything is clean and ready for when we integrate real-time sensor data. Understanding how to select features, handle missing values, and standardize inputs has been useful for improving model performance.
blockers: |
  Our turbidity sensor still isn’t producing readings that match expected clarity levels. Even after trying different calibration methods, the values remain inconsistent across samples, which is holding back our data collection goals.Another blocker was dealing with dataset formatting errors in Google Colab. When combining data from multiple CSV files, small inconsistencies like missing column names or unexpected null values caused import errors, which slowed down my workflow today.

reflection: |
  Despite these challenges, today felt productive because I’m becoming more comfortable troubleshooting both hardware and data issues. I’m learning to approach problems systematically, testing one change at a time rather than rushing through multiple adjustments. Seeing the sensors and machine learning models develop in parallel is motivating because it shows how both hardware and software are coming together to achieve our project goals. I’m looking forward to refining the calibration process tomorrow and testing early model predictions using sample data.
