what_i_learned: |
  Today I had the opportunity to explore Morgan State University, a historically Black university known for its strong programs in engineering, architecture, and community engagement. During our campus tour, I learned more about the legacy and impact Morgan has had on higher education and the surrounding Baltimore community. I also worked on PowerPoint slides highlighting my weekly progress, which helped me organize and present my accomplishments and challenges. Reading through related articles improved my understanding of our project's field and deepened my ability to analyze how existing research connects to our goals.

reflection: |
  Reflecting on today, I feel more connected to the purpose of our work and the academic environment supporting it. Being on campus gave me a sense of pride and motivation, especially learning about Morgan's history and contributions. Although searching for credible water quality data and making sense of complex articles was difficult, it pushed me to think more critically. Presenting our project name and logo also gave our group a stronger sense of identity, and I’m proud of how we worked together to express our vision clearly.
