  Today we worked on configuring the ESP32 development board with the Arduino IDE to begin testing pH levels using a buffer solution with a known pH of 7. We installed the necessary Arduino software and added support for the ESP32 board through the board manager to prepare for data collection. For the hardware, we used jumper wires, an adapter, and the ESP32 to assemble the circuit and connect the pH sensor. The sensor used was the DFRobot Gravity Analog pH Sensor Meter Kit V2 (SKU: SEN0161-V2), which is designed to measure pH values and display them in real time on the Serial Monitor. This process gave us hands-on experience in setting up physical components and working with serial communication. Even though we faced a few technical obstacles, it helped solidify my understanding of how sensor data flows from the hardware into the Arduino environment.

  One of the biggest challenges was getting the ESP32 board to successfully upload code. The Arduino IDE displayed the following error repeatedly: Despite switching cables and double-checking connections, the board wasn't recognized for uploading.

  Today’s work highlighted how detailed and sometimes frustrating hardware setup can be. Successfully building the physical system felt like a win, but the communication errors and calibration issues reminded me that troubleshooting is a big part of working with sensors and microcontrollers. Even though we didn’t fully resolve the upload or calibration problems, I feel like I have a stronger grasp on the process of building hardware setups and working with serial data. I’m looking forward to getting the ESP32 properly connected and seeing accurate pH readings in future tests.
