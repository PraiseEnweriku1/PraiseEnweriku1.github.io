what_i_learned: |
  Today, I continued building on our water quality project by implementing a neural network model using Keras to classify whether water samples are polluted or safe. I spent time cleaning and preparing the dataset, which included selecting only the numeric features needed for training and replacing missing values with their column means. I also learned how important it is to standardize features to improve the model’s training performance and make sure all variables are on the same scale. Alongside the coding work, I continued working on my PowerPoint slides for the mid-summer presentation. Organizing the slides helped me review and structure everything we’ve accomplished so far, and plan how to communicate it clearly to others. I also practiced giving a speech in front of a live audience today, which pushed me to speak more confidently and connect with listeners.

reflection: |
  Today showed me how coding and communication go hand in hand. Building the neural network felt rewarding, especially seeing the cleaned dataset flow smoothly through the model without errors. Practicing my speech also reminded me that it’s just as important to present our work confidently as it is to build it correctly. Overall, it was a productive day with strong progress on both technical and personal development skills.
