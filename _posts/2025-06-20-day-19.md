what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learned how to use a breadboard to connect multiple sensors to an ESP32, acting as a hub to manage both power and signal flow. I gained a clearer understanding of how analog signals from sensors like turbidity, pH, and temperature are read and processed by the microcontroller. Through this, I saw how essential proper pin connections and voltage management are for a functioning circuit. I also learned how to import and clean CSV datasets in Google Colab, which is helping us get better insights from our water quality data. On top of that, completing Kaggle’s ML courses taught me how to build, train, and evaluate machine learning models, a skill we’ll apply directly to our predictions later.

  One major challenge I faced was managing multiple sensor inputs through the ESP32, especially when signals overlapped or data didn’t show correctly.

reflection: |
  Looking back on today, I feel like I made meaningful progress not just in technical skills but also in understanding how all the pieces of our project connect. From hardware setup in TinkerCad to software tools like Colab and Firebase, I’m starting to see how everything contributes to a complete system. The hands-on work helped me feel more confident with the ESP32, and I can now better visualize how we’ll build our real-world water monitoring system. Even though some things didn’t work right away, I’m proud of how much we figured out through problem-solving and teamwork. This experience reminded me that growth happens most when things don’t go perfectly the first time.
