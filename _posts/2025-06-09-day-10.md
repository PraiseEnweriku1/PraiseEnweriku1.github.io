what_i_learned: |
  Today, I focused on learning the fundamentals of Arduino circuits through TinkerCad simulations and instructional videos. I explored how components like temperature sensors, water level sensors, relays, fans, and LCDs can be connected and controlled using Arduino code. Even though I didn’t physically work with a breadboard, I gained a solid understanding of how it's used to organize and connect circuits. The step-by-step guides helped me see how sensor data is read and used to trigger actions, which is really useful for building automated systems.

  One of the main challenges I faced was trying to visualize how the breadboard connections would look in real life, since I haven’t physically handled one yet. Understanding how the relay connects to both the sensor and output devices took extra effort and a couple of replays of the video. I also found it tricky to match the code exactly to the circuit components in TinkerCad without making mistakes. Figuring out how to use the LCD with the Arduino was also confusing at first, especially when it came to pin connections and displaying the right values.

reflection: |
  Even though I didn’t get hands-on experience today, I still feel like I made good progress in understanding how Arduino circuits function. The simulations in TinkerCad made it easier to see how components interact, and I’m more confident about working with real hardware soon. Watching how everything comes together in the videos made it clear why proper planning and wiring are so important. Overall, today gave me a good foundation to build on, and I’m looking forward to applying this knowledge in future tasks.
