what_i_learned: |

  In the early morning orientation we learned about how machine learning works, and the thought process that goes into formulating a project/research that can be worth investing resources. Also i learned something new called RAG which enhances accuracy of generatie AI models. Back at my research lab I started researching on blogs that have covered research simpler to mine and it definetly gave me more understanding and insight to innovations that can be done to better the project.



blockers: |

  No blockers.



reflection: |

  Working with my group during the marshmellow game to figure out how to get the marshmellow to stay up without falling while on a time crunch was definetly a good brain exercise. It also helped form a bond between my team mates and i. While doing research on our project i definetly felt like i had a team that is as driven as i am to make this project a success by how much input and ideas they were putting in during conversations.
