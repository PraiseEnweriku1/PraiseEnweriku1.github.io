what_i_learned: |
  Today, we spent the morning finalizing our PowerPoint slides for the weekly video report. We summarized our accomplishments, such as adding more models to our machine learning code and progressing with our research paper, as well as the challenges we faced like sensor calibration issues and data formatting errors. Recording the video helped us practice communicating our work clearly and confidently. Later in the day, our faculty mentor took us to the beach for team bonding activities. It was a refreshing break to relax, play games, and connect with everyone outside the lab environment. I learned that taking intentional breaks together really helps strengthen team dynamics and motivation.

reflection: |
  Today reminded me that celebrating progress as a team is just as important as the technical work itself. Recording our weekly report showed how far we’ve come this week, and the beach trip created a sense of community that I really appreciate. I’m feeling more refreshed and ready to continue working on our research paper and sensor testing on monday.  As a team today, we finalized and recorded our weekly presentation video, reflecting on our accomplishments and challenges, and engaged in meaningful team bonding activities at the beach with our mentor to build stronger collaboration for the coming weeks.
