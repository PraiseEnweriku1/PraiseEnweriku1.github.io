what_i_learned: |
   Today during cohort, we had a lecture on learning processes and styles, where I discovered more about my Myers-Briggs result, ESFJ, and how it connects to my VARK learning preferences. ESFJs concentrate on the present and base decisions on experience and facts, which is a strength for our water project because I can focus on practical testing, real data accuracy, and teamwork organization. My VARK and ESFJ style also means I learn best through structured hands-on activities, direct feedback, and clear real-world applications, which aligns well with our daily sensor calibration, machine learning modeling, and presentation preparations. After the cohort session, we went back to our labs to continue working on our project.

reflection: |
   Reflecting on my learning style today made me realize why I feel most productive when tasks have clear instructions and practical outcomes. It helps me stay grounded in what needs to be done each day while contributing meaningfully to my team. We finalized our revised calibration code for the turbidity sensor and ran a new set of tests to compare with previous results. We also reviewed our machine learning dataset to prepare for training updated classification models later this week. It felt good to see small improvements adding up and bringing us closer to reliable outputs for our water quality monitoring system.
