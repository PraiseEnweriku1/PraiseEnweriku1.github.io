what_i_learned: |
  Today we took some time to explore the basics of machine learning by completing a short course on Kaggle. It was a good introduction to how machine learning models work, especially in terms of training, testing, and understanding data. I appreciated how hands-on the course was, and it helped me connect what we’ve been learning with real world AI applications. It also made me more curious about how we might apply ML in our own project work later on.

  We didn’t hit any major roadblocks today, but recording the video took more effort than I expected. Making sure our points were clear, staying on the same page, and working around background noise or technical issues took some coordination. It was also a bit challenging to summarize a full week of work into just a few slides without leaving anything important out. But overall, we pulled it together well as a team.

reflection: |
  Today felt like a strong close to the week. Creating the PowerPoint helped us clearly organize what we’ve accomplished, what challenges we faced, and what we plan to work on next. Recording the video gave us a chance to practice presenting and speaking about our work, which was a great confidence boost. Combined with the Kaggle course, it really felt like a day full of both learning and progress. I’m looking forward to building on this momentum next week.
