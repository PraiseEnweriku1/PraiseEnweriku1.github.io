what_i_learned: |  
  Today, I focused on practicing my introduction speech for the Final Symposium. I noticed that I often play with my hands and stutter when speaking, which affects my confidence and delivery. One strategy that has been helping me is pacing myself by starting with a slightly off-topic hook to grab the audience’s attention and calm my nerves before diving into the presentation content. Practicing this technique is slowly improving my flow and making me feel more prepared. I also spent part of the day updating my machine learning code, making small adjustments to model parameters and preprocessing functions to continue improving accuracy for water quality classification.

  Public speaking remains a challenge for me, especially managing nervous habits like hand movements and stuttering. It will take continued practice to build confidence before the final presentation.

reflection: |  
  Practicing my symposium speech today reminded me that effective communication is just as important as the technical work we’ve done all summer. Although I still get nervous, using hooks and pacing techniques is helping me become a better presenter. I also felt productive making progress on my ML code, and I’m determined to balance both preparation and coding tasks as we approach the final showcase. Each day of practice is helping me feel more confident in sharing the value of our project with a larger audience.
