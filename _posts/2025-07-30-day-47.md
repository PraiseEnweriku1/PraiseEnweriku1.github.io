what_i_learned: |
  Today, we focused mainly on practicing for our final presentation. I worked on refining my delivery, especially the transitions between slides and keeping my speech clear and steady. Rehearsing in front of peers helped me identify areas where I could slow down and engage the audience better. It reminded me that strong communication is just as critical as solid research in making our work impactful.

  We also spent time trying to get the prediction model to run properly. However, refining prediction models takes time and multiple iterations to get consistent, reliable results. This process can be frustrating when things don’t work immediately, especially with limited time. We're continuing to work on it, testing various approaches and evaluating different model configurations to improve accuracy.

reflection: |
  Although we didn’t fully resolve the model issues today, practicing the presentation made me feel more prepared for the symposium. It helped me reconnect with the core of our project and remember why the work matters. The challenges with the model reminded me that research often involves trial and error, and that patience is part of the process. I’m learning to trust the work we've done and stay calm under pressure.
