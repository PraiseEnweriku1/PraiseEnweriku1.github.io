what_i_learned: |
  Today marked Day 31 of the program, and we shifted back into hands-on technical work after spending the past few days focusing on our mid-summer presentation. My team and I worked on improving the accuracy of our turbidity and pH sensors, testing out new calibration methods to get more reliable readings from our hardware setup. We also reviewed and adjusted parts of our machine learning code to prepare for integrating real-time sensor data into our classification models later on. It felt good to return to building and debugging. I learned that connecting code and hardware takes patience and attention to detail, especially because even small wiring adjustments or value changes in the Arduino code can impact the sensor outputs significantly.

blockers: |
  One major challenge today was that our turbidity sensor readings are still inconsistent, even after testing with different water samples, rechecking wiring, and modifying code thresholds. It’s frustrating not to see immediate improvement, but tomorrow we plan to read deeper into the datasheets and possibly research alternative calibration techniques. Another blocker was ensuring our machine learning datasets remain formatted correctly when switching between Google Colab and local testing environments. Small formatting errors or column mismatches can stop the training process, so we need to be extra careful with preprocessing.

reflection: |
  Even though today had its challenges, I feel like it was a productive step forward. Returning to troubleshooting mode reminded me how much more confident I’ve become with sensors, ESP32 wiring, and coding compared to the start of the program. I’m also learning to approach blockers calmly and treat them as opportunities to understand the system better. Overall, I’m excited to continue refining our sensors and models this week. Each day brings us closer to creating a water quality monitoring system that works reliably and has the potential to make a real impact.
