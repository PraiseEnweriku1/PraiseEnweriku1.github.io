what_i_learned: |
  Today, I continued working on calibrating our turbidity and pH sensors, testing multiple water samples and adjusting our Arduino code to refine voltage thresholds for more stable readings. This built on all the calibration work we’ve done this week, including reorganizing breadboard connections and learning sensor pin configurations from datasheets to improve accuracy. I also worked on our machine learning code in Google Colab, reviewing feature selection and data cleaning processes. Earlier this week, I implemented a neural network model using Keras to classify water as polluted or safe, and today’s dataset refinements will support more reliable training when integrated with real sensor data. Finally, I drafted an outline for our research paper, applying skills from our recent research writing workshop. I learned how having a structured outline makes the entire writing process smoother and ensures that our technical work is communicated clearly for publication.
blockers: |
  A major challenge today, continuing from this week, was the inconsistent turbidity sensor readings despite code adjustments and multiple sample tests. This is slowing down our data collection for training machine learning models. We plan to research alternative calibration approaches or check for hardware limitations tomorrow. Another ongoing blocker is managing dataset formatting errors when switching between Google Colab and local environments, as even small inconsistencies can interrupt model training workflows. Balancing technical debugging with research writing was mentally demanding today, similar to earlier in the week when shifting focus between building the neural network model and preparing mid-summer presentation slides took extra concentration.

reflection: |
  Looking back, this week was filled with meaningful accomplishments. I helped integrate the turbidity sensor into our ESP32 system, implemented multiple machine learning models including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks, and contributed to our mid-summer presentation preparation and delivery. Practicing public speaking also boosted my confidence in explaining technical topics clearly. Despite persistent sensor calibration issues and data formatting blockers, I feel myself growing as an engineer and researcher. Outlining our research paper today reminded me of the bigger purpose of this work and motivated me to keep refining our system and communication skills. Overall, today and this entire week showed me that progress comes in small steps, and combining hardware calibration, machine learning development, and writing will ultimately bring our project vision to life.
