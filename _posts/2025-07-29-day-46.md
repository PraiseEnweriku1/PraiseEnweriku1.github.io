what_i_learned: |
  Today I spent time refining both the delivery and structure of my final presentation. I practiced my speech multiple times, focusing on pacing, clarity, and minimizing nervous habits like fidgeting or stuttering. I also made final edits to our PowerPoint slides, ensuring that the visual flow matched the narrative I wanted to convey. In addition, I worked on polishing our demo video, making sure it clearly illustrated how our sensors and machine learning code come together to classify water quality. I learned that good storytelling and clear visuals are just as important as technical depth when communicating complex projects.

blockers: |
  Balancing several tasks at once—speech practice, slide editing, and demo finalization—was a bit overwhelming at times. It required careful time management to make sure each task received enough attention without sacrificing quality. I also found it challenging to make the demo video visually engaging while still being informative and accurate. To overcome this, I used a checklist and divided the day into blocks to focus on one task at a time, which helped me stay on track and feel less scattered.

reflection: |
    Practicing my presentation repeatedly helped me feel more confident and better prepared for the final symposium. Watching our demo video come together reminded me of how far the project has come since we first started. It’s exciting to see all of our work—hardware, software, and writing—blend into one final story that we can be proud to share. This process has taught me how much effort goes into not just doing research, but also communicating it effectively to an audience.
