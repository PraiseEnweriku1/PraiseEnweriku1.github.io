what_i_learned: |
   Today, our team focused on developing and practicing our elevator pitch for the water quality project. We worked on making it clear, concise, and engaging so that anyone can quickly understand the goal and impact of our system. Recording a creative video version of the pitch was fun and pushed us to think outside the box in communicating our ideas effectively. Aside from pitch recording, I spent the rest of the day continuing work on my machine learning code, debugging models, and optimizing their parameters to improve classification performance for water quality detection.

reflection: |
   Practicing and recording the elevator pitch today reminded me how important it is to explain technical projects in simple terms for general audiences. Combining creativity with clarity was challenging but rewarding. I also felt productive continuing ML development, and I’m motivated to push accuracy improvements tomorrow so we have strong results for our final presentations. Working on both communication and technical skills in one day showed me how these areas connect, it’s not enough to build something innovative if you can’t clearly share its purpose and impact with others. Today made me more confident in presenting my work and reaffirmed why strong communication is just as valuable as coding in research and engineering.
