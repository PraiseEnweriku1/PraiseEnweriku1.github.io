what_i_learned: |
  This practice presentation taught me how important it is to tie app features directly to real problems students face. Instead of just listing what the app does, I focused on why it matters and that shift made my pitch more impactful. I also realized that tone and body language matter just as much as content when delivering a presentation. Practicing today gave me a clearer vision of how I want to communicate in future professional settings like pitch competitions or investor meetings.

blockers: |
  One challenge was staying within the time limit while still giving enough context for each feature. I had to be selective with my words and skip over a few points I originally planned to share. Another difficulty was trying to connect emotionally with the audience while also keeping things professional. It’s a balance I’ll continue working on in future practice sessions to make my real-world presentations even stronger.

reflection: |
  Today was more than just a class assignment, it was a real step toward building my confidence for future public speaking and product pitching. Practicing with UniV3rse reminded me that building an app is one thing, but selling the vision is just as important. I’m proud of the progress I made and how much more clearly I can now express the value of this product. I look forward to refining how i give my pitch in future presentations.
