what_i_learned: |
  I was put in a pyhton 101 class that helped refresh my memory on using python functions, operators and the different data types. We also worked on some coding examples on replit. Towards the end of the session we played a kahoot game to test our understanding of the concept that was taught during the session. 


blockers: |
  I was a little stuck on how the operator module works, also too me a while to grasp the concept of using PEMDAS to solve an equation.


reflection: |
  Going over basic python concepts was really refreshing. The game we played after definetly helped me de-stress. Overall it's been a very productive and fun day. Can't wait to see what activities we have planned for tomorrow.
