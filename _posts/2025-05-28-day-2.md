what_i_learned: |
  I was put in a pyhton 101 class that helped refresh my memory on using python functions, operators and the different data types. We also worked on hands on work on replit and kahoot. 


blockers: |
  I was a little stuck on how the operator module works, also too me a while to grasp the concept of using PEMDAS to solve an equation.


reflection: |
  Seeing the filtered EEG patterns made the data feel much more real. I’m starting to see how crucial clean inputs are before even thinking about classification. Tomorrow, I’ll start prototyping a live attention monitor using thresholding on alpha power levels.
