what_i_learned: |
  Today, I built on the foundational knowledge from yesterday and explored more advanced simulations using Arduino in TinkerCad. I focused on how sensors like temperature and water level detectors interact with output components like fans, relays, and LCD displays. Watching the YouTube tutorials helped me better understand the logical flow between the code and the circuit. Even though I haven’t handled a physical breadboard yet, the simulations made these concepts much clearer and gave me confidence moving forward.

  One of the biggest challenges today was understanding how all the components would be physically arranged in a real circuit. I had to spend extra time reviewing how relays are wired and how the LCD connects to the Arduino pins without errors. Some of the example codes were slightly different from what I saw in TinkerCad, so troubleshooting those small mismatches took time. Overall, not working with the actual hardware yet made it harder to visualize, but the simulations helped bridge that gap.

reflection: |
  This second day of working with Arduino and TinkerCad felt like a solid step forward. I’m starting to see how digital logic, sensors, and real-world applications come together in engineering. Even though everything is still virtual, I’m building a much better mental model of how circuits function and how components respond to different inputs. I’m excited to eventually test this knowledge with real equipment and see how it all comes to life.
