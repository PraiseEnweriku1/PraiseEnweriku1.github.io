what_i_learned: |
  Building on yesterday’s UI session, today we started thinking more intentionally about how our sensor data will be displayed on a user interface. We brainstormed basic layouts and discussed which values (like turbidity and pH) are most important to surface clearly. The focus was on keeping the design simple, readable, and functional, especially for users who may not be technically inclined. On the hardware side, we continued working with both the turbidity and pH sensors. We tried new calibration methods—adjusting code thresholds, testing more diverse samples, and comparing results with visual observations. While the data isn’t perfect yet, we’re starting to notice patterns and edge conditions that can guide how we refine the readings.

  Today made it clear how connected sensor accuracy is to user trust. If the data displayed isn’t reliable or readable, it could reduce the system’s overall usefulness—even if the hardware and code are technically working. I feel like we’re in the stage of tightening things up, not just building, but refining and shaping the user experience around what the technology can (and can’t yet) do. It’s definitely a challenge, but it’s also where the real product starts to take form. I’m looking forward to translating our sketches into actual interface mockups soon.
