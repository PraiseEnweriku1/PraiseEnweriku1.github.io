what_i_learned: |
  Today, we had a research writing workshop where we learned about the fundamentals of research-based writing, planning, and completing a paper. One key takeaway was understanding how important it is to create a strong outline before starting to write. The workshop explained how having a clear outline helps organize your ideas, guides your literature review, and makes writing each section easier and more structured. Outside of the workshop, I continued working on calibrating our turbidity and pH sensors. I tested different sample setups to see how the readings responded and made minor code adjustments to improve stability. I also reviewed our machine learning scripts to make sure the dataset cleaning and standardization steps are solid for when we start training with real sensor data. Connecting our hardware work with data analysis feels more meaningful now that I understand how it will feed into our final research paper.

  Today made me realize how important it is to plan ahead in all areas whether it’s outlining a research paper or planning calibration tests systematically. The workshop gave me a clearer understanding of how our technical work will eventually be communicated in writing, and it motivated me to approach our upcoming research paper with confidence. Overall, it was a productive day with a good balance of professional development and technical problem-solving. I’m looking forward to refining our sensors further tomorrow and starting to draft possible outlines for our research publication.
