what_i_learned: |
  I did some more research on articles that are similar to my project. The article was about water quality assssment using an AI-integrated sensor system and spectroscopic analysis for real-time monitoring. The study addressed global water pollution and scarcity by demonstrating how machine learning models like Random Forest, SVM, and Neural Networks can accurately classify water samples as clean, contaminated, or UV-disinfected.

  Having to read through a scientifc article and basically understand what its about and put it in my own words is something i am still struggled with.

reflection: |
  My team and I were able to brainstorm and come up with a Project name and a logo. I also had to come out and present basically what I got from my research. Presenting helped me get a little bit more comfortable with public speaking and i believe before the end of the program i would have overcame my fear of public speaking.
