what_i_learned: |
  Today we focused on learning the basics of UI/UX design and why it plays a major role in creating systems that are easy to use. The training emphasized how user-friendly layouts, smooth navigation, and simple visuals can make sensor data much easier to understand. It gave me a better idea of how we need to present our project’s information in a way that is clear and accessible. After the UI/UX session, we went back to testing the turbidity sensor. We tried new water samples and created different testing setups to see how the sensor responded to changes in water clarity. It was helpful to test in a more controlled way and see how consistent the readings were over time. Connecting what we learned about user experience with sensor testing made me realize how important it is to plan for both the back-end data and the front-end user interaction from the very beginning.

  We are still facing issues with the turbidity sensor not showing much variation between samples. Even when we tested with different levels of water turbidity, the sensor didn’t pick up large changes. It might require more detailed calibration, or possibly the sensor isn’t sensitive enough for the current setup. While the UI/UX training didn’t present any direct obstacles, it made me think more about how we will eventually display pH and turbidity data in the app in a way that’s simple and easy to follow.

reflection: |
  Today made me think about how everything we are building connects to the person using the system. It’s not just about making the sensors work—it’s about making sure the data is useful and easy to read. Even though we’re still trying to solve the turbidity sensor issue, I feel like we’re making progress by improving how we test and setting up better experiments. I’m also looking forward to applying the UI/UX skills to design a clean, simple interface that brings all of our sensor data together in a way that makes sense for the user.
