what_i_learned: |
  Today, we had a workshop using drones connected to EMG sensors. We learned how these sensors can detect electrical signals from our muscles and translate them into commands to control the drone’s movement. It was fascinating to see how small changes in muscle tension could trigger the drone to lift or shift directions, showing a real-world application of biomedical engineering and robotics integration. After the workshop, I went back to the lab and continued working on my machine learning code, making further refinements to improve model performance for our water quality classification project.
blockers: |
  No major blockers today, but integrating new techniques into existing ML code always requires careful debugging and testing to avoid unintended errors.

reflection: |
  The EMG drone workshop today showed me how diverse the applications of engineering and coding can be, from environmental sensing to biomedical controls. It was inspiring to see the creative ways technology can interact with the human body. I also felt accomplished making progress on my ML code afterwards, and I’m motivated to keep improving it as we approach our final presentation.
