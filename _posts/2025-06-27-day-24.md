what_i_learned: |
  Today we began working on writing our research paper for publication based on our water contamination project. We started by looking up other published articles related to our topic, focusing on papers that were simpler and more accessible so we could understand how to structure ours effectively. It was interesting to see how other researchers present their methodology, results, and discussions clearly. We also worked on our weekly report, organizing everything we accomplished this week into our PowerPoint slides. Reviewing what we did helped us see how much progress we’ve made, especially with sensor integration and early data analysis. At the end of the day, we recorded a video presentation summarizing our report to clearly communicate our updates.

  Starting the research paper writing process today made the project feel even more real and impactful. It showed me that the work we’re doing could actually contribute to the field in some way, which is motivating. Reviewing our weekly accomplishments reminded me of how far we’ve come, even when progress feels slow day to day. Recording the presentation also helped me build confidence in explaining technical concepts clearly. Overall, today felt productive and meaningful, and I’m excited to continue writing the paper next week.
