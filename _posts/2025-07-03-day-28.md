what_i_learned: |
  Today, I continued working on our machine learning code for the water quality project. I focused on preparing the dataset by cleaning and selecting only numeric features, replacing missing values with their column means, and standardizing the inputs to improve model training performance. Implementing these preprocessing steps made me realize how critical it is to prepare clean data before feeding it into any model for accurate results. I also learned about different classification algorithms and how they can each provide unique perspectives on the dataset. Testing models like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks showed me the importance of comparing outputs to choose the most effective approach for water contamination detection.

  Today was productive because I applied both my programming knowledge and new data science skills to move the machine learning part of our project forward. It felt rewarding to see the models begin to produce preliminary classification outputs, even though they still need optimization. This progress motivated me to continue improving model performance and preparing our dataset for final training. As a team today, we tested additional sensor data samples for integration into the dataset and I worked individually on developing the classification models in Google Colab. These combined efforts bring us closer to our goal of creating a reliable system to detect polluted versus safe water samples.
