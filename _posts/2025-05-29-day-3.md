what_i_learned: |
  In the first session we learnt about Computer vision. I learned that there are two types which are object detection and image detection. Also worked on a computer vision model called "Teachable machine" for practing object detection. In the second session I learnt about I/O cycle and was able to use real world example to grasp the concept of it. Last thing we worked on for the day was using the input function to calculates wages, restaurant bill and tips.

reflection: |
  I had never used google collab until today. This being my first time using it for the computer vision workshop I would say it was really easy and straight forward. Relearning new concepts in python 101 with hands-on workshop helped me know what part of the lesson I didn't really understand enabling me to ask questions during the lesson.
