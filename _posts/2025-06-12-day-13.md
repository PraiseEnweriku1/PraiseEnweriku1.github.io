  Today started off a little differently than usual and honestly, it was refreshing. We kicked things off with our Thursday Cohort Connect session, which included some bonding games that brought out everyone’s competitive side. It was a fun way to connect with people outside my immediate team and get to know others in a more relaxed setting. Afterward, my team regrouped and reviewed what we accomplished throughout the week, what we struggled with, and began outlining our final presentation. It really helped to talk things through together and get a better picture of the progress we've made.

  Today was a great balance of work and fun. The cohort bonding games gave the day a positive and relaxed energy, and it was nice to laugh and connect with others. Later, reflecting with my team about the week helped me appreciate how far we’ve come especially in learning new tools like Arduino and TinkerCad. Even the minor tech issues turned into learning moments that made us more prepared moving forward. Overall, I’m feeling more confident in both our group dynamic and our upcoming presentation. It’s exciting to see things coming together.
