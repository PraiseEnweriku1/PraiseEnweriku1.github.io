what_i_learned: |
  Today, I focused mainly on **writing the methodology section for our research paper**. I documented our sensor calibration process, the steps we took to connect and integrate each sensor with the ESP32, and how we set up our machine learning models for classifying water quality data. Writing out these details helped me better understand the importance of clearly explaining technical procedures for publication. I also learned that describing methodologies requires being specific about equipment, data preprocessing steps, and code implementation so that other researchers can replicate or build upon our work in the future.

  Writing the methodology today made me realize how much technical progress we have made over the past few weeks. Seeing all the steps laid out reminded me that even small contributions each day add up to meaningful achievements. It also motivated me to focus more on improving calibration tomorrow so that our documented methods lead to strong and reliable results. As a team today, we continued **testing our turbidity and pH sensors with updated calibration code** and organized parts of our research paper draft. We also reviewed our machine learning dataset formatting to prepare for training new models once we have cleaner sensor data.
