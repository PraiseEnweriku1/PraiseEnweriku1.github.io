what_i_learned: |
  My team focused on integrating the TBD sensor into the setup today. While some worked on wiring and calibration, I contributed to documenting the sensor's role in the system and how it improves the overall monitoring process. We also expanded our knowledge of Firebase by experimenting with its real-time database capabilities. Understanding how to structure and send data from the ESP32 to Firebase helped us troubleshoot the system. I focused on creating detailed notes about the steps involved for future reference. For the presentation, I worked on simplifying the slides by breaking down complex sections into easy to understand visuals. This made the content more accessible for diverse audiences while still showcasing our technical achievements.  
  
blockers: |
  The TBD sensor calibration required a lot of trial and error to match expected values, causing delays. Firebase connection intermittently dropped during the demo, which interrupted the testing process. Documenting the detailed setup process took longer than anticipated due to the complexity of the system.    

reflection: |
  Today showed how teamwork allows us to divide tasks effectively and learn from each other. While the technical challenges with the sensor and Firebase were frustrating, solving them as a group helped improve our understanding. The updated slides now feel clearer and more polished, which will help us better communicate the project’s goals and progress. Overall, it was a productive day that reinforced the value of persistence and collaboration.
