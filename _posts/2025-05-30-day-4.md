what_i_learned: |
  Understood the concept of conditionals in psuedocode and how to apply it to code using if/else statements.

  Had a little hard time converting psuedocode that had to do with conditionals into actual code.

reflection: |
  Many computer science concepts are mapped to real life concepts.
