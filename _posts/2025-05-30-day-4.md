what_i_learned: |
  Understood the concept of conditionals in psuedocode and how to apply it to code using if/else statements. Also learned how to make use of relational operators and logical operators in my code. In the second session i learned about Generative AI. there have been four evolution of generative AI which are; Artificial intelligence, Machine learning, Deep learning, and Geenerative AI.

blockers: |
  Had a little hard time converting psuedocode that had to do with conditionals into actual code.

reflection: |
  Many computer science concepts are mapped to real life concepts. Played around in some generative AI websites like SUNO AI, which is used for creating music and it was really fun and easy to use. It was interesting figuring out how AI predictions are made. Lastly I feel like AI generated photos are starting to look too much like real photos because I couldn't really tell the difference during the guessing activity.
