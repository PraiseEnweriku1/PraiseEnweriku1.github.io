what_i_learned: |
  Today, I began learning how to explore and understand data using the Pandas library in Python, which is a key tool in data science. I learned how to import it using import pandas as pd, and then how to load datasets into something called a DataFrame which is a table of data, like a spreadsheet. We worked with home pricing data from Melbourne as an example, and I practiced reading in a separate dataset from Iowa. I also learned how to generate summary statistics using Pandas, which helps you get a quick overview of trends and data types before moving into building a machine learning model.

  At first, it was a bit confusing to figure out where the files were located and how to properly load them using file paths. 

reflection: |
  The kaggle course was a great introduction to how real data science projects start. It helped me see how important it is to actually understand your data before doing anything else. I feel like I’m building a solid foundation, and now I’m more confident in using Pandas to work with data in a meaningful way. I’m excited to keep going and learn how to filter, model, and make predictions based on this kind of information.
