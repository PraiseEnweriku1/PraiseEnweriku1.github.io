what_i_learned: |
  This morning, we participated in a workshop focused on setting up our final research paper using Overleaf. The session covered how to organize sections, manage citations efficiently, and format the document professionally for publication. Learning to use Overleaf streamlined our writing process and made collaboration easier by keeping the paper version-controlled and accessible to all team members.  
  After the workshop, I returned to the lab and continued adding literature review content and citations to our paper. Incorporating relevant studies and properly citing sources strengthened the background and foundation of our research, moving us closer to a polished final draft.
blockers: |
  No major blockers today. However, ensuring that all citations are correctly formatted and linked required careful attention to detail and cross-checking references.

reflection: |
  Today was productive because the Overleaf workshop gave me practical tools to manage the research paper more efficiently, and I made significant progress by integrating comprehensive literature reviews. I feel confident that we are on track to submit a well-organized and thoroughly supported paper soon. Our team is steadily advancing on the research paper, with strong focus on completing the literature review and improving document formatting. The Overleaf setup will facilitate smoother collaboration as we finalize each section.
