what_i_learned: |
  Today was a turning point for our group as we officially welcomed high school teachers who will be working with us for the rest of the program. It was interesting to see how adding someone new to our group dynamic brought in fresh energy and perspectives. We started with a light icebreaker to introduce ourselves, share some interests, and make everyone feel comfortable. After that, we began walking the teacher through our project, explaining what we’ve been working on, the tools we’ve used like TinkerCad and Arduino, and what our main goals are. Practicing how to explain our ideas clearly helped me better understand the work myself, and I learned how to adjust my language to match the audience.

  One challenge we faced was rethinking how we explained certain technical parts of the project, especially to someone new who wasn’t there from day one. We had to go back and simplify some of our terminology, break down our progress into clearer milestones, and explain why specific components like sensors, relays, and LCDs were chosen. 

reflection: |
  Today reminded me that collaboration is more than just dividing up work, it’s about communicating ideas in ways that make everyone feel included and informed. Having teachers as part of our group is going to be a unique opportunity, because they bring a mix of curiosity, real-world insight, and fresh questions that challenge us to think deeper about our decisions. Starting the PowerPoint for our weekly presentation helped us reflect on everything we've accomplished this week, from completing parts of our Arduino simulation to troubleshooting problems in TinkerCad and developing our understanding of machine learning. Practicing our speaking skills for the video gave me more confidence in presenting, and I can already see how these weekly reflections are making us stronger as a team. I’m looking forward to building this momentum next week with even more clarity and collaboration.
