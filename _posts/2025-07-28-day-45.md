what_i_learned: |
  I worked on completing my part of the final presentation PowerPoint slides, specifically focusing on the **literature review and methodology** sections. I reviewed past research that informed our approach and clearly explained how our project combines hardware and machine learning to classify water quality. In addition, we finally got our **Firebase database connected to the Arduino**, which allows our sensor data to stream in real-time. This was a big technical milestone and brings us closer to a fully functional end-to-end system.

reflection: |
  Today felt like a major step forward in both our presentation prep and project implementation. Writing the literature review reminded me how much foundational work we’ve built upon, and getting Firebase to connect successfully made the hardware side feel much more complete. It’s exciting to see everything starting to come together just in time for the final stretch.
