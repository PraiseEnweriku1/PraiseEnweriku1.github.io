what_i_learned: |
  Today was about bringing two important parts of our project together—clean data and clean design. I worked in Google Colab to clean up a CSV file we’re using in our model. First, I removed the column we’re trying to predict, which is called "populationDensity", from the rest of the dataset using "drop()". Then I used "pd.to_numeric()" to convert all the values into numbers and filled any empty cells using the average value of each column with "fillna()". This step was necessary because machine learning models can’t work with missing or non-numeric data. After that, I spent the afternoon learning how to make a basic website using VS Code and Tailwind CSS. Tailwind made it really easy to design a layout with modern buttons, colors, and spacing. We ran the site on "http://localhost:5173/", which helped us test things quickly. We also added styles explored how responsive design works.

  It was cool to see how data and design go hand-in-hand. Cleaning the CSV helped me understand the structure and importance of accurate data before running any model. Making the website showed me how we can present our data in a way that’s not just useful but also understandable to others. Whether it’s for classmates or community members, I now see how design helps people actually use the information we’re working so hard to collect and clean.
