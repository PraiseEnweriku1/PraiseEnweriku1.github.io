what_i_learned: |
  Today I dove deeper into connecting the code with the actual circuit simulation in TinkerCad, and it helped me understand how software controls the hardware. I worked on making sensors trigger outputs like fans, heaters, and LCD displays. Writing the code and seeing how it instantly affected the components gave me a better understanding of how everything works together. Even though it’s just a simulation, it really felt like I was building something real.

blockers: |
  One issue I ran into was that some parts of the circuit wouldn’t light up or respond, especially the LCD and fan setup. I realized I had to go into the code and adjust the values for example, changing the pH levels just to get the system to react. It took a bit of trial and error, and sometimes the numbers didn’t seem to trigger anything until I made them more extreme. It was frustrating at first, but it taught me how important it is to match your code logic to the ranges your components actually respond to.

reflection: |
  Even though I haven’t worked with a real breadboard yet, today felt like a big step forward. Being able to debug both the circuit and the code made me feel more confident in my understanding. I’m learning that small things like using the right values or matching pins make a huge difference. It’s not always smooth, but figuring it out on my own is definitely the most satisfying part.
