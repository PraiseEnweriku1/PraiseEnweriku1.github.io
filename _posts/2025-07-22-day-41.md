what_i_learned: |
   Today, I focused on finalizing my section of the research paper, completing the literature review. Summarizing and synthesizing all the relevant studies gave me a clearer understanding of where our project fits within the broader water quality research field. It also helped strengthen the background and justification for our approach. After finishing the literature review, I returned to my machine learning code to debug some models that weren’t functioning properly. I reviewed their implementations, fixed data formatting issues, and ensured each model ran without errors so we can start comparing their performances effectively.

reflection: |
    Completing the literature review felt like a major milestone today. It was satisfying to see that section finalized and ready for integration into the paper. Debugging the ML models reminded me how important it is to stay patient when things don’t work immediately and systematically troubleshoot each error to move forward efficiently. Overall, today made me feel more confident about both my writing and coding skills as we approach the final stages of our project.
