what_i_learned: |
  I explored how to find official water quality data reports for different U.S. states using the USGS WaterQualityWatch website. I learned how to navigate the USGS site to select individual states (like New York) and view real-time water quality parameters such as specific conductance, pH, turbidity, and more. I found that data is organized by monitoring stations across the state, each providing up-to-date readings. I became aware of the importance of attributes like conductivity and nitrate levels when analyzing water quality, especially for AI-based monitoring systems.

reflection: |
  Today helped clarify what real-time water quality monitoring looks like in practice and what specific parameters are meaningful. I now see how AI can fill the gap between raw sensor data and actionable insights. The biggest takeaway is how important it is to match the right sensor with the right AI prediction target for accurate environmental monitoring. Today's assignment has made me more confident in using official data sources like USGS for future research or AI projects.
