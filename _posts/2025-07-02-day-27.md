  Today, we finished our PowerPoint slides for the mid-summer presentation and did a full mock presentation to prepare. Going through the slides as a team helped me see how our individual contributions connect into one cohesive project story. It also gave me a chance to reflect on everything I’ve worked on so far. Personally, I contributed by assisting with the physical integration of system components, connecting the ESP32 to the breadboard, and troubleshooting cable and power issues to make sure each sensor worked properly. I also helped identify correct pin placements for our TDS, pH, and turbidity sensors, despite initially being unfamiliar with the breadboard layout. On the software side, I’ve been working on the machine learning code that we’ll use to classify water quality data after the Arduino and Firebase integration. Some models I’m using include Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks, each bringing different strengths to classify water as safe or polluted.

  A few challenges I encountered were managing limited breadboard space, which made wiring multiple sensors tricky, and initial power issues where some sensors weren’t receiving enough voltage. Not having prior experience with ESP32 pin layouts also meant I had to spend extra time learning about the sensor datasheets and wiring diagrams. During the mock presentation, I also noticed I need to slow down my speaking pace and make sure I explain technical terms clearly for audiences who might not have an engineering background.

reflection: |
  Doing the mock presentation today boosted my confidence. It helped me see where I can improve my explanations and reminded me that being able to communicate my technical work clearly is just as important as building it. I’m proud of how I’ve grown from wiring hardware and learning pin placements to implementing ML models that mimic the human brain. Overall, today felt productive and motivating. Finalizing our slides and practicing together made our team feel stronger and more prepared for the upcoming presentation.
