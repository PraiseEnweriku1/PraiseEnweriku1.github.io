what_i_learned: |
  Today we made major progress on both the hardware and software sides of our project. We added a turbidity sensor to the ESP32 and figured out the Arduino code needed to read its output. We also began setting up a machine learning model in Google Colab using a sample water quality dataset. This step is helping us prepare for when we start feeding in real data directly from our sensors. It was exciting to see the whole system from sensing water quality to training the data start to connect in a meaningful way.

  One of the ongoing challenges we’re facing is that we’re not yet getting accurate readings from our turbidity and pH sensors. The values have been inconsistent, and we're still working on calibrating them properly with the ESP32. We also ran into some minor issues with sensor wiring and making sure the analog inputs match up with the code. On the machine learning side, formatting and uploading the dataset in Google Colab took some troubleshooting, but we managed to get it prepped for early training.

reflection: |
  Even with some technical hiccups, today felt like a strong step forward for the project. We’re not just planning anymore, we’re actually seeing things come together through coding, hardware integration, and early model training. The fact that we’re already thinking ahead to how real sensor data will fit into our AI model shows how much we’ve grown. We also continued building out our slides for Friday’s presentation, making sure our process, progress, and goals are clearly communicated. I’m proud of how far we’ve come and excited to keep improving, especially once we start getting cleaner data from the sensors.
