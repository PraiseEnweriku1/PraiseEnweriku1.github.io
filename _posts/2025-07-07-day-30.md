what_i_learned: |
   Today was the first day back after our mid-summer presentation, and it felt good to take a moment to reflect on everything we’ve accomplished so far. We started the morning by discussing how the presentation went, what feedback we received, and what parts we were proud of. It was interesting to hear everyone’s perspective and realize that each person saw different strengths and areas for improvement. We also began thinking about what our next steps are for the remainder of the program. For me, that means continuing to refine our machine learning models, improving sensor calibration, and starting to think about how we’ll bring everything together for the final demo day. It was a more relaxed day, but also a good reminder that we’re only halfway through and there’s still plenty of work ahead.

reflection: |
   Today reminded me of the importance of pacing myself in long-term projects. The presentation was a big milestone, but it’s not the end, just a checkpoint showing us how far we’ve come and what we still need to achieve. Reflecting as a team helped us celebrate our wins and also acknowledge where we can push ourselves further. I feel recharged and motivated to keep building, testing, and learning. I’m excited to see how our project will continue to grow in the second half of the program
